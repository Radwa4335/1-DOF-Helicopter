# 1-DOF-Helicopter with PD Controller
Project Overview
------------------
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a 1-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) helicopter model controlled using a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. The system focuses on controlling the pitch angle of the helicopter using real-time feedback from sensors and a control loop.

System Components
------------------
Arduino UNO: Used for signal processing and control implementation.
Coreless Motor: Drives the helicopterâ€™s pitch movement.
MPU 6050 IMU Sensor: Provides real-time feedback on the helicopter's pitch angle.

Implementation
-----------------
The LabVIEW LINX Toolkit was used to interface with the Arduino UNO using serial communication.
