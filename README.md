# 1-DOF-Helicopter with PD Controller
This project features a 1-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) helicopter system controlled using a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. The setup aims to simulate the dynamic behavior of a simplified helicopter model, focusing on the control of its pitch angle. The PD controller is implemented to ensure stable and precise attitude control by minimizing errors in the system. This project is a hands-on demonstration of control theory applications in aerospace systems.
