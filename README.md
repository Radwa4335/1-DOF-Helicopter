# 1-DOF-Helicopter
1-DOF Helicopter with PD Controller

Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a 1 Degree of Freedom (1-DOF) helicopter model using a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. The system simulates the pitch control of a helicopter in a simplified environment, where the main focus is controlling the rotation of a single axis (pitch).

Objectives:
The goal of this project is to:
Model the dynamics of a 1-DOF helicopter.
Implement a PD controller to achieve stable pitch control.
Minimize the error between the desired and actual pitch angles.
Provide a foundation for learning control systems, particularly PD control, in aerospace applications.

Features:
1-DOF Helicopter Simulation: Simulates the pitch dynamics of a helicopter with limited movement.
PD Controller: Proportional-derivative control is used to maintain stability and reduce oscillations.
Real-time Feedback: The system constantly monitors the pitch angle and adjusts the control input accordingly.

System Requirements:
1- LabVIEW (for simulation and control design).
2- Hardware setup (if applicable).
